From SRP046754, SRR1572047, SRR1572048, SRR1572145, and SRR1572146 were commented out because the FASTQ files appear to be invalid. (Sequences are numbers?)

ERR313171 eliminated from batch 20 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR313177 eliminated from batch 29 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR731442 eliminated from batch 30 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR910012 eliminated from batch 32 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR313179 eliminated from batch 33 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR313173 eliminated from batch 38 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR661167 eliminated from batch 50 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR313172 eliminated from batch 52 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR455334 eliminated from batch 55 because fastq-dump kept crashing trying to unpack it.
SRR1792678 eliminated from batch 60 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
Batch 53 was failing on bigwig output step because reduce was timing out, so it was restarted at that step with longer mapreduce.task.timeout. We narrowed the issue to bedGraphToBigWig hanging on a particular bed file. We SSHed to the cluster and used gdb to exit the bedGraphToBigWig process to advance the job flow; we also saved the offending BED file. The destination BW was SRR191419.T.bw.
SRR1792708 eliminated from batch 62 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
ERR313163 eliminated from batch 62 because fastq-dump was unpacking it really slowly.
